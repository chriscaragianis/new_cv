An <em>antimagic graph labeling</em> is a consecutive {1,2,...,e}
edge labeling with the property that the sum of labels incident to
each vertex is distinct.  This research characterizes <em>totally
antimagic graphs</em>, i.e., graphs that admit no consecutive edge
labelings that are not antimagic.
